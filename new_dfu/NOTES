Travis Goodspeed has prepared a bootloader for the MD380 that is compatible with
the factory bootloader, but does not lock out reading the device memory via the
STM32 ROM DFU or SWD. This means you can download, upload, and inspect arbitrary
memory using the ROM DFU or SWD, while still using the bootloader to load the
manufacturer's binaries.

To flash the MD380 with the jailbreak bootloader you must first solder on a wire
to test pads to pull BOOT0 to VDD, boot into the STM32 ROM DFU, and do the
following to erase everything from the chip:

```
touch emptyflash
dfu-util --device 0483:df11 --alt 0 --dfuse-address 0:force:mass-erase:unprotect --download emptyflash
```

Then, reset the device, and upload the jailbreak bootloader.

```
dfu-util --device 0483:df11 --alt 0 --dfuse-address 0x08000000 --download jailbreak.bin --reset
```

# appalachian.bin

Travis Goodspeed patched the manufacturer's firmware for Appalachian i18n,
changing the string "Contacts" to "Neighbors" in the top level menu. This binary
also includes the jailbroken bootloader. Use the same method to load it as with
the jailbreak bootloader above.
