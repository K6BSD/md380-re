Travis Goodspeed has prepared a bootloader for the MD380 that is compatible with
the factory bootloader, but does not lock out reading the device memory via the
STM32 ROM DFU. This means you can run whatever custom code you want on the
MD380, while still restoring it to the manufacturer's software. It also means
you can inspect the manufacturer's software while it is loaded on the device!

To flash the MD380 with the jailbreak bootloader you must first solder on a wire
to test pads to pull BOOT0 to VDD, boot into the STM32 ROM DFU, and do the
following to erase everything from the chip:

```
touch emptyflash
dfu-util --device 0483:df11 --alt 0 --dfuse-address 0:force:mass-erase:unprotect --download emptyflash
```

Then, reset the device, and upload the jailbreak bootloader.

```
dfu-util --device 0483:df11 --alt 0 --dfuse-address 0x08000000 --download jailbreak.bin --reset
```
